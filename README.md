How to import in eclipse:
 Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project

Be sure to have m2e (Eclipse MAven Plugin) installed and also m2e-wtp so you can
run it via the eclipse "Servers" tab.

After import -> deploy the app to your Server (Tomcat for the sake of simplicity)
and visit:
http://localhost:8080/restapi/

To access the one-and-only test REST resource, visit:
http://localhost:8080/restapi/api/test
